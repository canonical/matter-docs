# Build your first Matter device with a Raspberry Pi

This tutorial walks you through setting up a Matter Lighting device on a Raspberry Pi.
We will use the [matter-pi-gpio-commander] snap which contains a lighting app built on top of the Matter SDK.
The application supports communication over WiFi/Ethernet as well as Thread.

## Hardware
In this guide, we use the following hardware:
- A **PC** running Ubuntu 22.04
- A Raspberry **Pi** 4B with Ubuntu Server 22.04 (64-bit) - but it also works on Ubuntu Core 22
- A 10mm 3v LED

![Setup's Diagram](pi-gpio-commander/Pi-GPIO4-LED.fritzing.svg)

Since we use a large 3v LED, we can directly connect it to the GPIO. We connect the LED to GPIO 4 (pin 7) and GND (pin 9). Refer [here](https://pinout.xyz/), for the Raspberry Pi pinout.

## Setup
In this section, we'll install and configure the [matter-pi-gpio-commander] snap.

SSH to the Raspberry Pi and install the snap:

```bash
sudo snap install matter-pi-gpio-commander
```

The application uses a
[custom-device](https://snapcraft.io/docs/custom-device-interface)
interface to access the GPIO. 
The interface should automatically connected upon installation. 
We can verify that by looking at the connections:
```console
$ sudo snap connections matter-pi-gpio-commander 
Interface      Plug                                      Slot                                      Notes
...
custom-device  matter-pi-gpio-commander:custom-gpio      matter-pi-gpio-commander:custom-gpio-dev  -
...
```

````{note}
On **Ubuntu Core**, the `custom-gpio` interface doesn't auto connect (See issue [#77](https://github.com/canonical/matter-pi-gpio-commander/issues/77)).
Connect manually:
```bash
sudo snap connect matter-pi-gpio-commander:custom-gpio matter-pi-gpio-commander:custom-gpio-dev
```
````


### Configure the GPIO
Set the GPIO pin/line to 4:
```bash
sudo snap set matter-pi-gpio-commander gpio=4
```

Apart from the GPIO pin, you may need to configure the GPIO chip.
The chip number is set to `0` by default which is suitable for us, since we use a Raspberry Pi 4.

The default is good for Raspberry Pi 4 and all older arm64 Pis.  
For Raspberry Pi 5, the chip should be set to `4` to use `/dev/gpiochip4`:
```bash
sudo snap set matter-pi-gpio-commander gpiochip=4
```

Any value other than `0` and `4` gets rejected.
If for some specific case you want to use a different chip, you can set:
```bash
sudo snap set matter-pi-gpio-commander gpiochip-validation=false
```

### Test the GPIO

The application is almost ready to start and join a Matter network.
But before doing so, it is better to test it locally to see if we can control the GPIO via the app:
```console
$ sudo matter-pi-gpio-commander.test-blink
GPIO: 4
GPIOCHIP: 0
Setting GPIO 4 to Off
Setting GPIO 4 to On
Setting GPIO 4 to Off
Setting GPIO 4 to On
Setting GPIO 4 to Off
Setting GPIO 4 to On
^C
```
Take a look at the logs and the LED. If there are no errors and the LED blinks every half second, we are ready to proceed!
Use Ctrl+C to stop the application.

### CLI flags

The application supports a range of CLI arguments implemented by the Matter SDK.

For a list of supported CLI arguments, execute `matter-pi-gpio-commander.help`.

```console
$ matter-pi-gpio-commander.help
Usage: /snap/matter-pi-gpio-commander/x3/bin/lighting-app [opti

GENERAL OPTIONS

  --ble-device <number>
       The device number for CHIPoBLE, without 'hci' prefix, can be found by hciconfig.

  --wifi
       Enable WiFi management via wpa_supplicant.

  --thread
       Enable Thread management via ot-agent.

  ...

```

For example, to override the default passcode:
```bash
sudo snap set matter-pi-gpio-commander args="--passcode 1234"
```

Multiple CLI arguments can be concatenated with a space. For example: 
```bash
sudo snap set matter-pi-gpio-commander args="--passcode 1234 --ble-device 1"
```


### DNS-SD

The application uses DNS-SD to register itself and be discovered over the local network.
To allow that we need to manually grant access:
```bash
sudo snap connect matter-pi-gpio-commander:avahi-control
```

````{important}
The above command assumes that the `avahi-control` interface is provided by the system. This isn't always the case.

To make DNS-SD discovery work, the host needs to have a running avahi-daemon
which can be installed with `sudo apt install avahi-daemon`.

On **Ubuntu Core**, the `avahi-control` interface is not provided by the system. Instead, it depends on the [Avahi snap](https://snapcraft.io/avahi).
To use the interface from that snap, run:
```bash
sudo snap install avahi
sudo snap connect matter-pi-gpio-commander:avahi-control avahi:avahi-control
```
````

### Thread 
If using Thread instead of WiFi/Ethernet, set `--thread` as a CLI argument:
```bash
sudo snap set matter-pi-gpio-commander args="--thread"
```

Note that Thread communication requires a Thread Radio Co-Processor (RCP) and
an OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) agent enabling that communication over DBus.

To allow communication with the [OTBR Snap] for Thread management, connect the following interface:

```bash
sudo snap connect matter-pi-gpio-commander:otbr-dbus-wpan0 \
                  openthread-border-router:dbus-wpan0
```      

Refer to 

### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

To allow the device to advertise itself over Bluetooth Low Energy:
```bash
sudo snap connect matter-pi-gpio-commander:bluez
```

BLE advertisement is required when operating the application in Thread mode.

````{important}
BLE advertisement depends on BlueZ which can be installed with
`sudo apt install bluez`.

On **Ubuntu Core**, the `bluez` interface is not provided by the system. 
The interface can instead be consumed from the [BlueZ snap](https://snapcraft.io/bluez):
```bash
sudo snap install bluez
sudo snap connect matter-pi-gpio-commander:bluez bluez:service
```

````


### Start the application

Now, let's start the application service:
```bash
sudo snap start matter-pi-gpio-commander
```

You can monitor the logs with:
```bash
sudo snap logs -n 100 -f matter-pi-gpio-commander
```
Keep it running in a dedicate terminal window. We will commission and control the application in the next section.

## Setup Chip Tool
We need a Matter Controller to commission and control the device. 
We will use Chip Tool which is a CLI Matter controller. 

Install the [chip-tool] snap on the PC:
```bash
sudo snap install chip-tool
```

## Commission

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} WiFi/Ethernet

Assuming the Pi and PC are connected to the same network, we should be able to commission the device by discovering its IP address via DNS-SD.

To pair:
```bash
sudo chip-tool pairing onnetwork 110 20202021
```
where:
- `110` is the node id being assigned to this device
- `20202021` is the default setup passcode
````

````{group-tab} Thread

Assuming that Chip Tool and the Thread Border Router are on the same network,
we should be able to discover the Border Router via DNS-SD.

```{important}
The same pre-conditions explained before apply in order to use DNS-SD 
and BLE:
the corresponding Debian packages / Snaps need to be installed in advance.
```

Pair the Thread device over Bluetooth LE
```bash
sudo chip-tool pairing ble-thread 110 hex:<active-dataset> 20202021 3840
```
where:
- `110` is the assigned node ID for the app.
- `<active-dataset>` is the Thread network's Active Operational Dataset in hex, taken using the `ot-ctl` command before.
- `20202021` is the PIN code set on the app.
- `3840` is the discriminator ID.


````
`````



If this doesn't work, it may be because it has taken too long to reach this step and the device has stopped listening to commissioning requests. Try restarting it on the application with `sudo snap restart matter-pi-gpio-commander`.

## Control
There are a few ways to control the device. The `toggle` command is stateless and simplest. 
```
sudo chip-tool onoff toggle 110 1
```
