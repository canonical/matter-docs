.. The `Example product documentation`_ shows how to set up a Di√°taxis structure in Sphinx.

.. For quick help on reST or MyST syntax, see the :file:`doc-cheat-sheet.rst.txt` or :file:`doc-cheat-sheet-myst.md.txt` files in the repository.
.. (Open the files in your text editor; the rendered output is not very useful.)

.. More information is available in the `reStructuredText style guide`_.
